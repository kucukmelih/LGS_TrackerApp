**LGS Tracker App**: A C# Windows Forms application developed to help both students and administrators manage and track results of mock LGS (High School Entrance Exams) in an efficient and user-friendly way.

The app supports two roles:
- **Admin**: Can add, update, and delete student records, enter exam results, and view detailed performance statistics.
- **Student**: Can view their own exam history, success rates, and performance charts.

**Key Features**:
- **Performance Visualization**: View student progress with charts showing scores and success rates across multiple exams.
- **Color-Coded Feedback**: Automatically highlights strong and weak results using success rate-based color indicators.
- **PDF & CSV Export**: Easily generate and download detailed exam reports for individual students or overall data summaries.
- **PDF Integration**: Automatically extracts correct, wrong, and blank answer counts from scanned PDF files.
- **Multi-Exam Tracking**: Each mock exam is listed separately, and clicking on one reveals detailed performance data.
- **Report Viewer**: Generate and export detailed student reports in PDF format based on selected exams.
- **Database Integration**: Uses MySQL to store all student and exam data securely and efficiently.

The application is designed with a focus on simplicity, data accuracy, and usability. It helps schools and educational institutions save time by automating result analysis and reducing manual entry errors. The clean UI and intuitive layout make it easy for both admins and students to navigate and use the system.

This project showcases skills in C#, MySQL, Windows Forms, data visualization, file handling, and basic OCR/PDF parsing. Itâ€™s a comprehensive solution tailored for tracking academic performance in a real-world scenario.
